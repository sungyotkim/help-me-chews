    reviewContent: `Cute spot in east village! Cute interior ambience and the wait staff are all very friendly. There's a good amount of variety on the menu without it being overwhelming. I definitely recommend the nanban don and the garlic beef steak personally. The drinks taste and look great too but i believe they're all sake-based so be mindful of that.`,

    reviewContent: `If you're looking for a good bowl of ramen, definitely check out Tonchin. Highly recommend snagging a reservation if you can, though they do take walk-ins. I walked in on a wednesday right when they opened and was able to get a spot at the counter but the place filled up shortly after. The tonchin tonkatsu is their classic and it was really good. The broth was quite clean - it didn't leave me feeling super heavy or sluggish like ramen usually does. It comes out super quick too, within 5 minutes (as ramen should). They also gave me a disposable bib so as to not get my shirt dirty which was also appreciated!`,
